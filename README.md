# Pothole-Detection-using-ML

### Requirements:
Language - Python 3.8.0
Software – Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset link:
1.	Download the dataset from this link
https://www.kaggle.com/virenbr11/pothole-and-plain-rode-images/download
2.	Download and extract the file
3.	Rename the file to “Data”

### Steps to execute our code:

1.	Install Conda system software following the instructions given in the link: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html

2.	Open Anaconda Prompt.

3.	Create virtual environments for python with Conda following the instructions given in the link

https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/

4.	Download the following python packages:
●	pytest-shutil
●	tensorflow
●	Keras
●	matplotlib
●	numpy
●	scikit-learn
●	joblib

5.	Move to the directory where all the files (codes, dataset) provided are saved.

6.	Open Jupyter Notebook by using the command “jupyter notebook” in Conda prompt and open the “pothole detection.ipynb” file.

7.	Change the directory name of the dataset in the code from “C:/Users/Shreshth/Downloads/Data/Data” under “Setting Directory Paths” to your own folder location.

8.	Run each chunk/cell of the code.

9.	It will take time for classifiers to get trained, at the end you can upload your own image of the road to detect the presence of potholes using all three classifiers.
